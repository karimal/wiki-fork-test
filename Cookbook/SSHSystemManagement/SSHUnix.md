SSH tools for generic Unix
==========================

to init
-------

```
c=j.ssh.connect("localhost",verbose=True) #this returns a cuisine object (like above) which is verbose in output, if you don't want that put on False
u=j.ssh.unix.get(c) #use the generic unix sal, feed it the cuisine connection

```

to change passwd
----------------
```
u.changePasswd(self, passwd, login='recovery')
```
find
----

```
find(self,path,recursive=True,pattern="",findstatement="",type="",contentsearch="",extendinfo=False):
        """
        @param findstatement can be used if you want to use your own find arguments
        for help on find see http://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_mono/find.html
        @param pattern e.g. */config/j* 

            *   Matches any zero or more characters.
            ?   Matches any one character.
            [string] Matches exactly one character that is a member of the string string. 
                This is called a character class. As a shorthand, string may contain ranges, which consist of two characters with a dash between them. 
                For example, the class ‘[a-z0-9_]’ matches a lowercase letter, a number, or an underscore. 
                You can negate a class by placing a ‘!’ or ‘^’ immediately after the opening bracket. 
                Thus, ‘[^A-Z@]’ matches any character except an uppercase letter or an at sign.
            \ Removes the special meaning of the character that follows it. This works even in character classes. 

        @param type

            b    block (buffered) special
            c    character (unbuffered) special
            d    directory
            p    named pipe (FIFO)
            f    regular file
            l    symbolic link

        @param contentsearch
            looks for this content inside the files

        @param extendinfo   : this will return [[$path,$sizeinkb,$epochmod]]

        """

#example

c=j.ssh.connect("localhost",verbose=True)
u=j.ssh.unix.get(c)

execute bash script

secure the remote environment
-----------------------------

* actions
    * will set recovery passwd for user recovery
    * will create a recovery user account
    * will disable all other users to use ssh (so only user 'recovery' can login & do sudo -s)
    * will authorize key identified with sshkeypath
    * will do some tricks to secure sshdaemon e.g. no pam, no root access.
* locked down server where only the specified key can access and through the recovery created user


```
c=j.ssh.connect("localhost",verbose=True)
u=j.ssh.unix.secureSSH(self,sshkeypath,recoverypasswd=""):
    
```

tmux
----
* executeRemoteTmuxCmd(cmd) #execute a cmd in tmux session
* executeRemoteTmuxJumpscript(script) #execute a jumpscript remote 
    * @param script is the content of the script

other useful cmds
-----------------

* changePasswd(passwd,login="recovery")
