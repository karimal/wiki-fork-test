Workers
=======

Descriptions
------------

Workers are lightweight processes that check for work on their queue.

By default we have 3 different kind of queues.

-   default: We have two workers listening on the default queue doing
    all kinds of miscelanous tasks
-   io: There is one IO queue which is typical used for backup/restore
    and long IO bound related work.
-   hypervisor: There is one Hypervisor queue which takes on tasks
    related to VM management.
