Agentcontroller
===============

Description.
------------

The Agentcontroller is repsonsible of distrubuting the work over the
nodes. This can be accomplished by specifying a specific node id to
execute on or based on a role.

Roles.
------

Each node can provided a role. Roles define what each node is capable of
doing.

Executing of a task (Jumpscript)
--------------------------------

In JumpScale one can define a task in a [Jumpscript](Jumpscript) As
[Jumpscript](Jumpscript) defines a set of intruction to execute how and
where to do so.

Agentcontroller client
----------------------

### ExcecuteJumpscript

In the JSShell one can execute a task as followed

```python
import JumpScale.grid.agentcontroller
acl = j.clients.agentcontroller.get()
job = acl.executeJumpscript(organization='jumpscale', name='jumpscale', nid=1, role=None, args={'msg':'bleh'}, timeout=600, wait=True, queue='')
print job['result']
```

#### Paramters Explained

-   organization: is the organization the Jumpscript is written by
-   name: the name of the jumpscript
-   nid: This is the node id of the node that should execute is (can be
    overruled by role)
-   role: If role is specified it will be used instead of nid, the
    agentcontroller will search for a node which specifies this role and
    execute it on this node. If multiple nodes match a role the first
    available will be chosen.
-   args: This is a dictionary of arguments to give to the Jumpscript
-   wait: When we want to perform a task either async or sync we can
    choose to wait for the result when providing False this method will
    return a Job object which is either queued or in progress.
-   queue: With the parameter queue one can specify on which worker to
    execute his/her task.

#### remarks

when more than 1 node matches the role then only the first matching one
will be used

### ListSessions

This method provides an insight on which nodes are connected to the
AgentController. It provides which nodes is connected with which roles.

```python
import JumpScale.grid.agentcontroller
acl = j.clients.agentcontroller.get()
sessions = acl.listSessions()
```
