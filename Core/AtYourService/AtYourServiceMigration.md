How to convert JPackage to AtYourService template
-------------------------------------------------

AtYourService is a fork of JPackage so the change from a jpackage to a service should be quite straight forward.

1. **action.py**  
    In action.py file, check that the value you get from the hrd have still the same name.
    In @YS, the hrd data from service.hrd are prefix with 'service.' and the data from instance.hrd are prefix with 'instance.'  
    So for example if in instance.hrd there is something like :
    ```
    param.port=22
    param.ip=123.234.1.3
    ```
    In the action.py file, you have to get these values using :
    ```
    $(instance.param.port)
    $(instance.param.ip)
    ```

2. **service.hrd**
    - It's a good practice to add a '**description**' item inside the service.hrd file.
    This info could be use to display information about this service through a portal for example.

    - **category**  
    In @YS you can specify a category for your service.  
    a use case for these categories is the creation of a link between a 'node' service like [node.ssh](https://github.com/Jumpscale/ays_jumpscale7/tree/master/_ays/node.ssh) and another service that need to be executed inside this node.
    example :
    ```python
    # here we simply create a node.ssh service
    # node.ssh has a category 'node' in its service.hrd
    node = j.atyourservice.new(name='node.ssh',instance='node1')
    node.init()
    node.install()

    # then we create a mongodb service and we want it to be installed inside the  
    # node previously created. Do to that we use the 'comsune' method.
    # consume take two arguments, first is the category of service we want to consume  
    # the second is the instance name of a service that provide this category
    mongodb = j.atyourservice.new(name='mongodb',instance='main')
    mongodb.consume('node',node.instance)
    mongodb.init()
    mongodb.install()
    ```
    If we look in the service.hrd file of the mongodb service, we can find
    ```
    'producer.node = 'node1'
    ```
    which means that mongodb cosume a service of the category 'node' and wich instance name is 'node1'
    This is an exmaple of the flexibility @ys gives you to create complexes relations between your services.
