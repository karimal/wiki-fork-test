Architecture and General Overview
==================================

![Jumpscale Architecture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/526328/5579704/a8f9aec8-9047-11e4-9a45-e2c756f15d4f.jpg)

#### JS Node
* A machine running jumpscale framework.
* We've different types of JS nodes:
  * **CPU Node:** A machine running a hypervisor
  * **Firewall node:** A machine running a firewall
  * **Application node:**

#### OSIS Server
* An abstract layer that supports different backend databases; mainly, [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) & [InfluxDB](influxdb.com)
*  [InfluxDB](influxdb.com) is used to store statistical and log data while [MongoDB](www.mongodb.org) is the main database
* All database operations are handled by OSIS and different components can connect to OSIS server using OSIS client.
* More info about [OSIS](OSIS)

#### Centralized HEKA Server
* Every JS Node has a local [HEKA](https://github.com/mozilla-services/heka) server that pushes local stats and logs into the centralized server.
* Collects logs, aggregates stats and pushes them into [InfluxDB](influxdb.com)

#### Agent controller
* It can interact with [OSIS](OSIS)
* Controls the whole cloud / acts as a Job controller
* It can schedule tasks on a JS Nodes [i.e start a virtual machine on a CPU Node]
* Uses [Redis](redis.io) database as a task queue system.

#### JumpScripts
* Python scripts that are meant to do certain tasks
* executed/updated by JSAgent on a JS node
* Execution of jumpscripts on the same machine or different machine(s) is handled by Agent controller.
* JSAgent can get Jumpscripts updates through webdis on the Agent Controller

#### Portal
* A web application to control the cloud, see logs, errors, manage users and execute tasks.
* Portal has a special and powerful wiki syntax to create new pages very quickly.
* Portal supports Markdown as well.

#### JPackage

* Jumpscale comes with its own packaging system that enables you to create/install/update/ packages
